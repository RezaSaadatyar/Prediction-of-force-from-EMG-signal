**EMG force-Torque estimation**
***This repository includes the MATLAB & Python codes of muscle force prediction from EMG siganls using different models***<br>

**Python:**<br/>
:arrow_forward: The program will run automatically when you run **code/file Main.py**, and you do not need to run any of the other codes. Depending on your goal, you can execute all steps independently or interdependently within the code/file main. In addition, you can copy and run each section along with its related files in your own code or disable each section with **#**. To run the program, the only thing you need is your input, which is **data = Your data**. In this project, the torque signal is equal ***data***, and the sum of these 4 muscles is equal ***Input_Data***.
